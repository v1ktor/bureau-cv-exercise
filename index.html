                    Guardtime was founded with a mission to make the world's information universally reliable, without
                    reliance on the risks of human trust. Their invention, KSI, was originally designed to support the
                    Estonian Government in its quest for zero-trust systems i.e. systems that can provide formally
                    verifiable mathematical proof of the correctness of operations.
